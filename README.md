FizzBuzz
Task Description

The FizzBuzz implementation in Python is not producing the correct output. The issue arises when the number 15 is encountered; it should print "FizzBuzz" but currently prints "Fizz."
Instructions

Check the provided Python script in 0-fizzbuzz.py and correct the FizzBuzz logic.
Print Square
Task Description

The JavaScript script for printing a square is not functioning as expected. When attempting to print a square of size 10, the output is incorrect.
Instructions

Examine the JavaScript code in 1-print_square.js and rectify the logic to generate a square of the specified size.
Sort
Task Description

The Ruby script for sorting arguments is encountering issues when non-numeric values are present. It fails to handle these cases gracefully.
Instructions

Inspect the Ruby script in 2-sort.rb and modify the sorting logic to accommodate non-numeric arguments.
User Password
Task Description

The Python implementation of a User class is flawed. The is_valid_password method is not functioning correctly, causing test cases to print errors.
Instructions

Review the Python script in 3-user.py and fix the is_valid_password method to ensure it returns the correct output.
Double Linked List
Task Description

The C implementation of a double linked list is exhibiting unexpected behavior. After performing various operations on the list, the output does not align with expectations.
Instructions

Investigate the C code in 4-delete_dnodeint and address any issues to ensure proper functionality of the double linked list operations.
