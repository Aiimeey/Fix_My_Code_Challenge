Fix My Code Challenge
Overview

Fix My Code Challenge is a project designed for debugging and fixing issues in existing code implementations. The goal is to identify and rectify errors without rewriting the entire codebase. The challenge covers various programming languages, including Python, Javascript, Ruby, and C.
Tasks
    FizzBuzz (Python):
        Issue: The FizzBuzz implementation is not producing the correct output for certain values, specifically when the number 15 is encountered.
        Potential Fix: Check the FizzBuzz logic to ensure that when the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 (e.g., 15), it prints "FizzBuzz" instead of just "Fizz."

    Print Square (Javascript):
        Issue: The script for printing a square in Javascript is not working as expected.
        Potential Fix: Review the Javascript code to verify that it correctly generates a square of the specified size using the appropriate number of '#' characters.

    Sort (Ruby):
        Issue: Sorting arguments in Ruby is not functioning correctly, especially when non-numeric values are present.
        Potential Fix: Modify the sorting logic in Ruby to handle non-numeric arguments gracefully, ensuring that the script sorts and displays the arguments in ascending order.

    User Password (Python):
        Issue: The User class in Python has a problem with password validation.
        Potential Fix: Examine the code for the User class and focus on the is_valid_password method to ensure that it returns True for the correct password. Check for any logical errors or incorrect comparisons.

    Double Linked List (C):
        Issue: The C implementation of a double linked list is exhibiting unexpected behavior after performing various operations.
        Potential Fix: Investigate the C code for the double linked list operations. Check for errors in memory management, node deletion, and overall list traversal to ensure that the list functions as expected.
